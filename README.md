# Do not use

Promotion Wizard (AU and UK) used to import the Alliance repo https://github.com/AllianceSoftware/python-docx, which was a fork of an early version of https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx with some customisations. Depending on Alliance's public repos was deemed unacceptable, so our Promotion Wizard repos have been updated to depend on Plexus' repos instead.

*This* repo was previously located at https://github.com/Plexlogic/python-docx and identical to the Alliance repo, although it did not appear to be referenced anyway. It has since been moved to https://github.com/Plexlogic/python-docx-deprecated, and is being kept for backup purposes (but can probably be deleted). In any case it should not be used or referenced.
